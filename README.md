# p5-life

p5js project, coding a two player version of Conway's game of Life.
I will start as a two player on one local device, using the device like a chess board.
But I hope to be able to add and online gaming mode.

While it's an offline game it will be delivered here in the form of a source code that you can execute on any browser even some mobile phones on android can directly execute it. The latest stable release here will also be shortly available on my website so that truly any device can access it.

There are plans to make an app for iOS and Android devices, starting with android.

## Installation instructions

The best way to install this game is to go to the **release** section of the github project and download the latest stable release. The source code is bundled in a .zip file that you can extract anywhere on your computer.
Then open _index.html_ with your favorite web-browser. You can also drag-and-drop _index.html_ on an empty browser tab.
